# Acceptance: Workspace Web Keycloak + App Subscription

1) Workspace web shows Keycloak login and exposes user identity after auth.
2) Projects and endpoints load from Nucleus GraphQL using bearer token.
3) App catalog shows endpoint templates + auth modes for selected project.
4) Subscribing an app stores credentials in keystore and creates app instance + user app + project app.
5) Docs + env examples reflect Keycloak + keystore configuration.
6) Unit + integration tests recorded.
